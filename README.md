Audience: Prospective employers

Statement: I want to create an easy to use ecommerce web application for pet owners that have dogs and/or cats with restricted diets. 

Elevator pitch: This web application will allow pet owners to find information on why their cat or dog is getting ill after eating or having a hard time eating. It will recommend what kinds of food and supplies will help them regulate their pet's diet and allow them to purchase these items directly on the page.
